### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher and director at the [Quantum-Safe Migration Center (QSMC)](https://www.qsmc.org/) which is part of the Taiwanese PQC start-up [Chelpis Quantum Tech](https://www.chelpis.com/) based in Taipei, Taiwan.

Before that, I was a postdoc at the [Institute of Information Science](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/) of Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.<br />
Before that, I was at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), Bochum, Germany. <br />
Before that, I was at the [Digital Security group](https://www.ru.nl/ds/) at Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. <br />
Before that, I was at the [University of Surrey](https://surrey.ac.uk/department-computer-science/research/secure-systems-research-group), Guildford, United Kingdom.

In 2022, I obtained my PhD from [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/), Nijmegen, The Netherlands under the supervision of [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/) and [Bo-Yin Yang](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/byyang/). My dissertation on **Polynomial Multiplication for Post-Quantum Cryptography** is available [here](https://kannwischer.eu/thesis/).<br />
In 2017, I obtained my MSc in IT Security from [TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) under the supervision of [Juliane KrÃ¤mer](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/informatics-data-science/qpc/team/prof-dr-juliane-kraemer/index.html) and [Denis Butin](http://www.amphawa.eu/). My master thesis is available [here](https://kannwischer.eu/theses/MasterThesisMatthiasKannwischerFINAL.pdf).


I'm a co-submitter of the UOV and [MAYO]((https://pqmayo.org/)) signature schemes which have been submitted [NIST PQC digital-signature competition]((https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig)). <br />
I have also been co-submitter of the [Rainbow](https://www.pqcrainbow.org/) (RIP) signature scheme which was a finalist in the [NIST PQC](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography) project.
